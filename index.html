        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Musician</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Oscar Pulido, and I am from the San Fernando Valley, located in Los Angeles County. I am currently a student at UCR pursuing a degree in psychology. I love music, and at the moment I am obsessed with pop-punk, math rock, and trap. I love learning new things, especially those in the media and technology category. I love experimenting in programs such as Photoshop, Logic Pro X, and Final Cut Pro. In highschool, I took numerous classes regarding these courses. I love editing, and creating content. I first started out with a horror instagram account in middle school, where I would create and post content. Through this instagram page, I amassed over 180 thousand followers, and learned how to create graphics. I primarily utilized photoshop to design my own posts, and to design graphics in order to brand my page. From this instagram account, I also started creating content on youtube, in which I would read scary stories. Through this, I began to get interested in sound design and editing. <br><br>

        When I was 16 years old I started to produce music using Logic Pro X. Although admittedly terrible at first, throughout the years I have steadily improved my craft. I was mainly self taught, but I took advantage of youtube tutorials to help me get to where I wanted to be. These days, music is my passion. I enjoy new songs from various genres, and appreciate the hard work and artistic creativity that went into creating each track. I primarily focus on producing music in the hip/hop genre, but I have dabbled into electronic music such as techno and house. As a child, I learned the basics of percussion instruments for several years. I took that prior music theory knowledge and applied it to my work today. I loved playing the drums back then, so I found it fun to start making beats. At first, I created chill beats known as “Chill Hop” but I expanded into creating trap beats for my friends to rap on. <br><br>

        Whenever I am bored, or just looking for an escape, I always end up creating beats. Music production is a huge field, and I think there is always more to learn, and new techniques to try. I’ve gotten better at mixing through constant practice over the years, but my mastering could use a lot of improvement. I feel like mastering music is an art in itself, and is insanely difficult. I’ve recently started to focus on recording vocals, and attempting to get the most out of my recordings. Through the years I have tweaked my vocal chains into something I can be satisfied with. These days, I have released music through several streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music. I just recently released an album of beats I’ve been working on for about a year. I love music, and I love learning new things!
